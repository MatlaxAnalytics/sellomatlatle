								In this project I have visualised the fatal shootings of people by the police in the United States of America. This dataset was downloaded from The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">@washingtonpost</a> on August 16, 2022. Four (4) programs (Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI) were used throughout the project. The dataset was in excel csv format, cleaned in SQL and exported to excel file, explored in python, and the final product was visualised in Power BI.
